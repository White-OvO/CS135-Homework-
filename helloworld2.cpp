#include <iostream>
// Step 1 : Setting Up and Running a Program in Visual Studio Code:



// step2 
/*

The asshignment involves creating a C++ program that outputs a formatted message to the terminal. The task includes writing a C++ program with the necessary preprocessor directives and a main() function. The output must match a specific format provided in the instructions. This exercise helps in becoming familiar with the process of compiling and running C++ code, as well as submitting work through CodeGrade for automated feedback.

Include the <iostream> library using preprocessor directives (#include <iostream>).

Use the std namespace to simplify the code (using namespace std;).

Define a main() function in the program.

Copy, paste, and output each line of the provided output message into the main() function, ensuring it matches the required format (see below for message).

Compile the program using g++ main.cpp and run it to verify that the output matches the expected result.

Submit the main.cpp file to CodeGrade, following the provided instructions on the Canvas page.
